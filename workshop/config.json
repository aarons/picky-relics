  "description": "This mod is just like Bossy Relics, but configurable. Relic rewards will provide one choice out of many.\n\nConfigurable from 0 to 5 choices for each type of relic. You can also choose if relics have a chance to be higher or lower tier than the original.\n\n---\n\nThere are 18 ai-generated language localizations, although the text is mostly just labels in the config menus. Any translation corrections are welcome!",
